# :cupid: Valentines Project :cupid:

### This is a funny way you can ask someone to be your valentine! :two_hearts:

## Features
- 🥰 A few funny gifs and pics
- ❌ Changing "No" button messages
- 🔄 Resizing buttons after clicking

## How It Works
This project asks your special someone to be their valentine, but we don't let them say no! (Consent is very important, this is very much just a silly thing).
